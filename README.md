# NENA-Civic-Address-Extensions-1
The NENA NG9-1-1 CLDXF standard (NENA-STA-004.1.1-2014) supports the exchange of United States civic location address information about 9-1-1 calls, both within the US and internationally. The NENA NG9-1-1 CLDXF standard covers civic location addresses within the United States, including its outlying territories and possessions. The NENA NG9-1-1 CLDXF standard defines the detailed data elements needed for address data exchange. CLDXF is the United States profile of IETF PIDF-LO, and it uses the PIDF-LO XML (Extensible Markup Language) schema, extended to include NENA-defined elements. This repository hosts these extensions.
